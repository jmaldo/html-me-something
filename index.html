                <h2>New Born through First Year</h2>
                <p>Nicholas (Niko) Edward Maldoando was born on August 16, 2014 at Via Christi in Wichita, KS. From his first day he was a tiny little guy that was wide eyed and courisity.
                    We relocated to Kansas City In October of that year and have been here since. He crawled at 6 months, walked and did his first swim lesson's at 9 months, and was talking at 10 months. He started to show his love of trains very early. He loves the two puppies he has and really started to have his personality start shine. He's inquistive, smart, oreny, and very loving.
                </p>

                <h2>Year 1 to Year 2</h2>
                <p>Niko's vocabulary continued to grow. Besides his speaking, his sign langaunage skills grew. He showed his love for KU (because brain washing start early!), Thomas the Train, baseball, and Dinosuar train. We still love our Seasame street and being out doors. My coursity still get's me in trouble but I have so much fun!</p>

                <h3>Year 3 to Now</h3>
                <p>Now I speak in full sentences. Sometimes I get so excited to speak I have to be calmed down to talk. I'm in preschool and besides learning number and letters, I've started to do addition. Sometimes I'm too smart for my own good
                    I love to help cook, do chores for allowance money, and sing and dance. I'm into Dinotrux, Chuggington, Star Wars, and Marvel and DC characters. My favorite color is <span class="yellow">yellow</span> and I love the Royals, Chiefs, Jayhawks, Red Sox and Sporitng KC. I'm still doing swimming and sports. I need to be a better listener but I'm getting there. I'm a loving little boy and can't wait to see what I'm going to do!
